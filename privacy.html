                and email) that you provide by completing forms on GoGreen, including if you register as a user of the Services,
                subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit any material through GoGreen, or request any information;
                <br>2. Your login details (username and token), in connection with the account sign-in process; <br>3. Details of
                any requests or transactions you may make through the Services; <br>4. Information about your activity on and

            can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other
            information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information. <br>3. Log file
            information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a
            web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser
            or device. <br>4. When you use our Service, our servers would be allowed to automatically record certain log file
            information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages
            and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages
            viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which
            then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows
            for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. <br>5. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or
            phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one
            or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or
            associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
            stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or
            other software, or data sent to the device by GoGreen <br>6. A device identifier may deliver information to us or
            to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or
            personalized content.
